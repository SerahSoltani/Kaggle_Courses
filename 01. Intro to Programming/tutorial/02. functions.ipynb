It is always enclosed in parentheses that apppear immediately after the name of the function.  (_Note that a function can also have no arguments, or it can have multiple arguments.  You'll see some examples of this later in the lesson._)  \n",

(_As you learn more about Python, you may need to indent your code by more than four spaces, but you'll learn more about that later in this course._)\n",

    "    - Then, the final line of code, called the **return statement**, just returns the value in `output_var` as the function's output.\n",

    "Depending on how we plan to use this new function `get_pay_with_more_inputs()`, it can be more useful than the original function `get_pay()`, because it addresses more cases.  Instead of potentially incorrectly assuming the hourly wage and tax bracket, the new function allows the user to specify the correct values.  But, if you're sure the hourly wage and tax bracket won't need to change, the new function is just more complicated than necessary.  In general, when defining functions, you'll need to consider how much flexibility you need, based on your use case. \n",
