These partners are local organizations working in communities to vet borrowers, provide services, and administer loans.\n\nIn this exercise, you'll investigate Kiva loans in the Philippines.  Can you identify regions that might be outside of Kiva's current network, in order to identify opportunities for recruiting new Field Partners?\n\nTo get started, run the code cell below to set up our feedback system.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import geopandas as gpd\n\nfrom learntools.core import binder\nbinder.bind(globals())\nfrom learntools.geospatial.ex1 import *","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-25T17:29:24.784159Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-25T17:29:24.784953Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-25T17:29:27.075233Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-25T17:29:24.784853Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-25T17:29:27.073987Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1) Get the data.\n\nUse the next cell to load the shapefile located at `loans_filepath` to create a GeoDataFrame `world_loans`.
